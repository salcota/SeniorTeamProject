For a first time contributor or someone with a messy local repository, type the following once:

1-In the directory where public_html resides:
  git clone https://github.com/ihsan-taha/csc648848sp17g04.git

2-Delete the old (non-empty) public_html directory:
  rm -rf public_html

3-Rename the new csc648848sp17g04 directory to public_html:
  mv csc648848sp17g04 public_html


Once you are back on track, you can do the following to update your contributions regularly:
1-Check current status:
  git status

2-Switch to the beta branch (only CEO or CTO will update beta with master and notify the team beforehand):
  git checkout beta

3-Modify a file and update to beta:
  git add <modified filename>
  git commit -m "description of what you are commiting"
  git push -u origin <beta>

This file will be updated according to the flow of Team 4's progress

(This part has been added after everything up to line 25)
After opening your account again, you will already be on beta branch, and you can repeat steps 1 and 3.
To work on your own branch, type: git checkout -b <your branch name>

This file will be upgraded according to the flow of Team 4's progress
